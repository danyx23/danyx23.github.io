        <div class="content">
        <p>At my film school we are currently finishing a project called &quot;Koks und Cola&quot; (Cocaine and Coke). It is a project were each filmmaker does one episode - black &amp; white, 16:9, max 3 actors, all shot in the same toilet - that we are cutting together now. Since I am responsible for finishing the movies and compiling a dvd, I want to use this opportunity to write something about all the little details that come up in a mixed platform, highly distributed independent film making environment. So, unless you are into the technical details of film making, this post will bore the hell out of you ;).</p>
<p>First off we had to come up with a way to get the edited films to my computer (a PC running Win XP) so I can finish them in After Effects. For miniDV Footage this is no big deal since QT/Avis with DV Codec can be saved from most editing software with a minimal amount of recompression (if you switch off &quot;recompress&quot; or &quot;recompress all frames&quot;, only the frames that change have to be recompessed, e.g. the fade-ins and -outs) and even recompressing the movie again is not that bad. However, quite a few of us shot using the Sony FX1 HDV Camera, and the one thing you don't want to do is recompress HDV Footage with the HDV Codec just to get it to After Effects. Since it does not store each frame on its own but a keyframe every 12 or 25 frames and then only the differences, even a simple hard cut leads to recompression, and since the resolution is about 6 times bigger with the same datarate, even a 2nd generation can copy can get pretty ugly.</p>
<p>So, what we do is we use the quicktime container and the PNG Codec (which is lossless but compresses the movie quite significantly) to get the HDV Movies into AE. Some of my fellow students were quite surprised to see export times of a few hours for 3-5 minutes of film, but considering the amount of data the poor computers have to munch through it's not so bad - high resolution comes at a price and the PNG Compression, while great for image fidelity, is certainly not the fastest.</p>
<p>Now after they rendered out the movie there comes the next little problem - how do you get files of 14 GB from a mac onto a pc? The easy way would be putting them onto an external harddrive, but my pc cannot read mac formatted disks and a mac cannot read NTFS (Win xp) formatted disks. Which leaves the possibility of a FAT32 formatted partition. Luckily I thought of this case when I bought my last external harddrive and kept a 40 GB Partition in FAT32. However, and this one is really annoying, FAT32 cannot store files bigger than 4 Gigs. So, we have to split them up. But, how do we do that? By opening a Terminal under Mac OS X and writing the command:</p>
<blockquote><p>tar -c -L 4000000 --file=/OUTPUTFILENAME INPUTFILENAME</p></blockquote>
<p>This will create a new file outputfilename and stop when it reaches 4 gigs. Then it will ask you to insert a new tape (stupid tar), so you rename the file to make room for a new 4 Gig junk and so on until you have several 4 Gig junks that you can reassemble on your pc.</p>
<p>Why go through all this trouble instead of using a network? Well, that means reconfiguring a Mac which is something I don't really like doing since I don't know them a lot and I hate to be responsible when things don't work anymore.</p>
<p>But, there is another alternative of course that I am considering at the moment: Getting <a title="Macdrive 6" target="_blank" href="http://www.media4.com/products/macdrive6/">MacDrive 6</a>&nbsp; . This lets you Windows PC access Mac formatted disks - quite useful when this case comes up more often.</p>
<p>So much for my current adventures of data wrangling. More to come soon! Yeehaaa!&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A few days ago my quest to study directing has finally come to an end as I have been accepted at <a title="Filmarche" href="http://www.filmarche.de">Filmarche</a>. This Film school is pretty special in that there are no dedicated Professors - instead the students organize their education themselfes, teaching each other and inviting people from the field for specific workshops/lectures. I think it sounds very promising and am pretty excited to see what it's like.</p>
<p>The website is currently still a bit of a temporary solution, I have to port everything over to the new version of the CMS I use and I'm still experimenting quite a bit. Once I'm done the whole navigation structure will hopefully make a lot more sense. So, please bear with it for the time beeing.<br /></p>

        <p>People are getting pretty crazy about soccer here in Berlin. There are almost no bars left that do not have a TV set standing around. Even if Germany doesn’t play there are crowds of people in those places watching the games. Tonight I strolled around the area where I live and took some photos (<a href="/gallery2/v/Other/berlinwm/" title="Photos from Berlin at night during world cup">view them here</a>). What makes this all even stranger is the sudden explosion of german flags - something unseen until a few weeks ago, but by now every second car and every third flat displays one. Pretty weird. I thought Germany had gotten over this patriotism thing… <br /><br />In totally different news, I’m making good progress on updateing the structure/navigation of this site, a new version will be online soon.<br /><br />And, last but not least, a film-tip: In the last few days I watched a lot of woody allen movies - If you haven’t seen it yet, definitly watch "Hollywood Ending", im my humble opinion his best movie to date, absolutely hillarious.<br /></p>

        <p>Maybe you have heard the quote, maybe you haven't. Well, here is another example of <a title="We call it life" href="http://streams.cei.org/">how scary our world really is</a>. Gives me the creeps. And while I'm at it: <a title="Du bist Deutschland" href="http://www.du-bist-deutschland.de">Du bist Deutschland</a>. Also scary, in a different way. And as if that wasn't enough, the <a title="Cicero" href="http://www.cicero.de/">cicero</a> magazine recently had a story about the new friendship between the bush clan and the clinton clan - reminds me of this piece in the brilliant &quot;Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy&quot; (pretext: a spaceship crashes into Harrods, opens its hatchway and a robot emerges)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I come in peace,&rdquo; it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, &ldquo;take me to your Lizard.&rdquo;</p><p>(Ford, the well-traveled space-adventurer then explains to Arthur, the human:)<br /><br />&hellip;&rdquo;It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, &ldquo;nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I though you said it was a democracy.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Ford. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Arthur, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t sounding ridiculously obtuse, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t the people get rid of the lizards?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It honestly doesn&rsquo;t occur to them,&rdquo; said Ford. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government they&rsquo;ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Ford with a shrug, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Because if they didn&rsquo;t vote for a lizard,&rdquo; said Ford, &ldquo;the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, &ldquo;have you got any gin?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look. Tell me about the lizards.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ford shrugged again.<br /><br />&ldquo;Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone&rsquo;s got to say it.&rdquo; <br /></p></blockquote>
