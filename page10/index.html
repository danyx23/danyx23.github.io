          <p>A few days ago my quest to study directing has finally come to an end as I have been accepted at <a title="Filmarche" href="http://www.filmarche.de">Filmarche</a>. This Film school is pretty special in that there are no dedicated Professors - instead the students organize their education themselfes, teaching each other and inviting people from the field for specific workshops/lectures. I think it sounds very promising and am pretty excited to see what it's like.</p>
<p>The website is currently still a bit of a temporary solution, I have to port everything over to the new version of the CMS I use and I'm still experimenting quite a bit. Once I'm done the whole navigation structure will hopefully make a lot more sense. So, please bear with it for the time beeing.<br /></p>

          <p>People are getting pretty crazy about soccer here in Berlin. There are almost no bars left that do not have a TV set standing around. Even if Germany doesn’t play there are crowds of people in those places watching the games. Tonight I strolled around the area where I live and took some photos (<a href="/gallery2/v/Other/berlinwm/" title="Photos from Berlin at night during world cup">view them here</a>). What makes this all even stranger is the sudden explosion of german flags - something unseen until a few weeks ago, but by now every second car and every third flat displays one. Pretty weird. I thought Germany had gotten over this patriotism thing… <br /><br />In totally different news, I’m making good progress on updateing the structure/navigation of this site, a new version will be online soon.<br /><br />And, last but not least, a film-tip: In the last few days I watched a lot of woody allen movies - If you haven’t seen it yet, definitly watch "Hollywood Ending", im my humble opinion his best movie to date, absolutely hillarious.<br /></p>

          <p>Maybe you have heard the quote, maybe you haven't. Well, here is another example of <a title="We call it life" href="http://streams.cei.org/">how scary our world really is</a>. Gives me the creeps. And while I'm at it: <a title="Du bist Deutschland" href="http://www.du-bist-deutschland.de">Du bist Deutschland</a>. Also scary, in a different way. And as if that wasn't enough, the <a title="Cicero" href="http://www.cicero.de/">cicero</a> magazine recently had a story about the new friendship between the bush clan and the clinton clan - reminds me of this piece in the brilliant &quot;Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy&quot; (pretext: a spaceship crashes into Harrods, opens its hatchway and a robot emerges)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I come in peace,&rdquo; it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, &ldquo;take me to your Lizard.&rdquo;</p><p>(Ford, the well-traveled space-adventurer then explains to Arthur, the human:)<br /><br />&hellip;&rdquo;It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, &ldquo;nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I though you said it was a democracy.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Ford. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Arthur, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t sounding ridiculously obtuse, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t the people get rid of the lizards?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It honestly doesn&rsquo;t occur to them,&rdquo; said Ford. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government they&rsquo;ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Ford with a shrug, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Because if they didn&rsquo;t vote for a lizard,&rdquo; said Ford, &ldquo;the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, &ldquo;have you got any gin?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look. Tell me about the lizards.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ford shrugged again.<br /><br />&ldquo;Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone&rsquo;s got to say it.&rdquo; <br /></p></blockquote>

          <p>Life is good again! My eye infection is gone and my new, shine, sexy <a title="X41" href="http://www-131.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=4611686018425155293&amp;storeId=10000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=4611686018425021052&amp;dualCurrId=1000073&amp;catalogId=-840">IBM/Lenovo X41</a> arrived - a convertible laptop (both laptop and tablet pc). I can work outside, use it as a notebook (as in, a bunch of paper sheets one draws and writes on) and use a whole bunch of <a title="powertoys for tablet pc" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/tabletpc.mspx">new, weird applications</a>. Among other uses its great to use it for drawing (I will never draw on paper again - how can anyone work without layers?). If you are considering buying a laptop in the near future, definitily try this sweety.</p>
<p>I also started redesigning this website a little, especially in regard to the structure of the site. I hope to put it online within the next two months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new script is also in the works. The working title is &quot;Die Gl&uuml;cksmaschine&quot; (the happiness machine). The story is about an old man suffering from parkinson who gets an operation that works a little too well - it makes him manic. The film is about the consequences this has on his relationship as well as the dilemma his doctors are faced with - should they get rid of the sideeffects, even if the patient likes them?</p>
