I finally finished moving this website to my new server and I used this opportunity to polish this website a little. Some links might have been broken but should work again soon. 

</p>

<p>

My last movie, Coriolis (it will have its own page here soon) is about to get finished. <a href="http://www.jfprins.com/" title="Jeanfrancois Prins">Jeanfran&ccedil;ois Prins</a>, an amazing jazz musician and incredibly friendly person is busy composing the music and I try to polish the visual end of the film. If all goes well we will be able to start sending it to festivals around the end of August.

</p>

<p>The shooting of my next film, Go, is approaching frighteningly fast (shooting is scheduled for mid-August at the moment). This film too will soon get it's own page on this site.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I will write more regularly now that the website has finally moved. Check back soon!</p>

The photos of Isys and Andreas&#39; wedding are online. The photos are password protected, so you need to obtain the password from Isy or Andreas to access them.

</p>

<p>

All photos were taken by Teresa Marenzi and me (Daniel Bachler) - except IsyAndreas-348 and IsyAndrea-349, those two were taken by Isy herself :). If you want to hire us as wedding photographers, feel free to <a href="/contact" title="contact">contact us</a> for any details!

        <p>Last week I shot my alpha project (the film you have to make after the first semester at the <a href="http://www.filmarche.de" target="_blank" title="Filmarche Filmschool">filmarche filmschool</a>), starring Anne von Keller and Cyrus Rahbar, DOP Inga Pfafferott, Producer Florinn Bareth, directed by yours truly. We went for both the dolly and the M2 35 mm Adapter, knowing that it was a bit of a gamble given our timeframe, but everything worked out nicely. We had a great team and I think the film will turn out to be beautiful. I know I sound like one of those lame hollywood making-ofs, but somehow I think everyone really put a lot of effort into this film and they deserve the praise :). Postproduction will take at least a month now and of course I will post more details as they emerge.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <p>At my film school we are currently finishing a project called &quot;Koks und Cola&quot; (Cocaine and Coke). It is a project were each filmmaker does one episode - black &amp; white, 16:9, max 3 actors, all shot in the same toilet - that we are cutting together now. Since I am responsible for finishing the movies and compiling a dvd, I want to use this opportunity to write something about all the little details that come up in a mixed platform, highly distributed independent film making environment. So, unless you are into the technical details of film making, this post will bore the hell out of you ;).</p>
<p>First off we had to come up with a way to get the edited films to my computer (a PC running Win XP) so I can finish them in After Effects. For miniDV Footage this is no big deal since QT/Avis with DV Codec can be saved from most editing software with a minimal amount of recompression (if you switch off &quot;recompress&quot; or &quot;recompress all frames&quot;, only the frames that change have to be recompessed, e.g. the fade-ins and -outs) and even recompressing the movie again is not that bad. However, quite a few of us shot using the Sony FX1 HDV Camera, and the one thing you don't want to do is recompress HDV Footage with the HDV Codec just to get it to After Effects. Since it does not store each frame on its own but a keyframe every 12 or 25 frames and then only the differences, even a simple hard cut leads to recompression, and since the resolution is about 6 times bigger with the same datarate, even a 2nd generation can copy can get pretty ugly.</p>
<p>So, what we do is we use the quicktime container and the PNG Codec (which is lossless but compresses the movie quite significantly) to get the HDV Movies into AE. Some of my fellow students were quite surprised to see export times of a few hours for 3-5 minutes of film, but considering the amount of data the poor computers have to munch through it's not so bad - high resolution comes at a price and the PNG Compression, while great for image fidelity, is certainly not the fastest.</p>
<p>Now after they rendered out the movie there comes the next little problem - how do you get files of 14 GB from a mac onto a pc? The easy way would be putting them onto an external harddrive, but my pc cannot read mac formatted disks and a mac cannot read NTFS (Win xp) formatted disks. Which leaves the possibility of a FAT32 formatted partition. Luckily I thought of this case when I bought my last external harddrive and kept a 40 GB Partition in FAT32. However, and this one is really annoying, FAT32 cannot store files bigger than 4 Gigs. So, we have to split them up. But, how do we do that? By opening a Terminal under Mac OS X and writing the command:</p>
<blockquote><p>tar -c -L 4000000 --file=/OUTPUTFILENAME INPUTFILENAME</p></blockquote>
<p>This will create a new file outputfilename and stop when it reaches 4 gigs. Then it will ask you to insert a new tape (stupid tar), so you rename the file to make room for a new 4 Gig junk and so on until you have several 4 Gig junks that you can reassemble on your pc.</p>
<p>Why go through all this trouble instead of using a network? Well, that means reconfiguring a Mac which is something I don't really like doing since I don't know them a lot and I hate to be responsible when things don't work anymore.</p>
<p>But, there is another alternative of course that I am considering at the moment: Getting <a title="Macdrive 6" target="_blank" href="http://www.media4.com/products/macdrive6/">MacDrive 6</a>&nbsp; . This lets you Windows PC access Mac formatted disks - quite useful when this case comes up more often.</p>
<p>So much for my current adventures of data wrangling. More to come soon! Yeehaaa!&nbsp;</p>
