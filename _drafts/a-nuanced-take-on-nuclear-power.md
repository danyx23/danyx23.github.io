In last years long post on my stance on climate change I left one topic out because I think it requires a lot of nuance and that post was really long as it was already. That topic is nuclear power. I listened to several podcasts lately and realized that there are few topics that make me disagree with any side as much as nuclear power, and so I thought it would be a good topic for another blog post.

Since this will be a long post again, I want to try to give you the outline of my argument straight up: first arguing why it is a lot better than it's critics claim, then making the case why I think it is not in a position to help significantly with climate change in the next 20 years. Here comes the outline, with much more elaboration further down.

Nuclear power is a relatively safe technology - Chernobly was very poorly designed and the other two big accidents in the history of nuclear power have not caused any direct human casualties.
Using coal for electricity generations needs to burn such vast amounts of coal that the trace amounts of radioactive isotopes released into the environment by coal far outweight those released by nuclear power.
New power plants could be designed to be passively safe, i.e. to not require active cooling as many current power plants do (and which can lead to accidents like Fukushima)
Alternative fuel cycles than the current Uranium 235/238 ones could use a much higher proportion of their fuel and lead to a lot less waste
France relies heavily on nuclear power and has one of the best greenhouse gas emission balances of all advanced economies
Mankind at the end of the 21st century will probably find it easier to deal with a few concentrated deposits of highly radioactive substances than with a radically warmer planet

And yet:

The interesting alternative fuel cycle, passively safe reactor designs are still on the drawing board and far from commercially viable and probably 20 years out even if we were to heavily invest in them now
Nuclear power plants need a certain size for thermal efficency. They also require substantial infrastructure built around them per reactor; and they have relatively fixed cost for security, safety, validation etc. All this leads to a strong preference of big installations over small ones
This bias towards big installations means that they will always be big infrastructure projects
As such they tend to have cost overruns and delays and competition and market forces don't work well
Even if we could make small firms compete, we wouldn't want half-finished reactor buildings or irradiated cores to be standing around if a startup goes bust
In electricity markets they are a poor
