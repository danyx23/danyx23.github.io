        <h1><a href="/web/2005/05/25/why-i-use-gpg.html">Why I use GPG</a></h1>
        <p class="author">
          <span class="date">25 May 2005</span>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <h3>What is gpg?</h3>
<p><a title="GPG homepage" target="_self" href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)</a> is a piece of software that can basically do two things:<br /> </p>
<ul>   <li>encrypt/decrypt every kind of data so that only you or the persons you choose are able to read/use it.</li>   <li>sign/verify data so that you can be sure that the data originates from the person you think it originates from.</li> </ul>
<p>The encryption gpg provides is generally believed to be sufficiently strong that not even big players like the NSA (a US secret service) should be able to break it.</p>
<h3>Why use it?</h3>
<p class="longtext">Whether or not you want to use encryption is of course up to you. Something that many people are not aware of is the fact that e-mail is not cofidential in any way - it's as if you would write a letter to someone without putting it into an envelope. Everyone who happens to handle the e-mail or access your e-mail account on the server can read the entire mail withouth you noticing. If you want any amount of privacy in your e-mails or write about buisiness-critical information via mail you should definitily consider it. I encrypt my mail traffic with some people and you are welcome to send me encrypted mail (for my key etc please go to the <a title="Contact" target="_self" href="/node/1/">contact page</a>). For someone else to read the message he has to use pgp or gpg and you need her public key. Since not every person has gpg installed, this is usually only done when neccessary/available. What I do with every mail tough, is to sign it. This attaches a .sig file to the mail in question that can be used to verify with gpg that I was the sender of this message. The message itself is sent in clear-text and can be read by anyone (this includes the intended reader, regardless of whether she has gpg installed as well as any cracker who might intercept the message). If the receiver wants to be sure that the message originated from me, she can verify the message with gpg and my public key. I invite everyone to do the same as this helps weed out spam - currently every spam e-mail can contain every sender e-mail adress it chooses, which would be immediatly detected were the message signed.</p>

        <h1><a href="/web/2005/05/25/how-del-icio-us-changes-the-web.html">How del.icio.us changes the web</a></h1>
        <p class="author">
          <span class="date">25 May 2005</span>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>If you don't use <a href="http://del.icio.us" target="_blank" title="Delicious social bookmarking">del.icio.us</a> yet, hop over, register a user and start storing your bookmarks (aka favorites) online. Besides having your bookmarks available to you from every computer that has internet access, it also enables you to browse the web in a whole new way - by finding users who bookmark similar content for example. (See which pages I have bookmarked at delicious by navigating to <a href="http://del.icio.us/DanyX/" target="_self" title="Delicious bookmarks of danyx">http://del.icio.us/DanyX/</a> )<br />  </p>
<p>Delicious lets you store a description and so called tags (=keywords) together with the bookmark. You can choose them freely, whatever makes sense to you. You can then view your links by tag (<a href="http://del.icio.us/DanyX/art" target="_self" title="Art tagged delicious bookmarks">see my delicious links tagged with art for example</a>) and you can also view which pages have been bookmarked with this tag by any delicious user. (<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/art" target="_blank" title="Art delicious links">here are all pages tagged with art</a>)<br /> </p>
<p>What I find so interesting about this is that it lets you view the web from a totally new perspective. Up until now, I mostly used google plus a few news pages to browse the web, plus occasionaly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia online encyclopedia">wikipedia</a>. Whenever I would stumble upon something interesting in real-life, I would google it. This would return those pages that google thinks are most relevant - which basically means that this page has the most pages linking to it. For certain things this works fine, e.g. if you are looking for the webpage of a huge company (when I enter IBM, Industiral buisiness machines is the first google hit and should be). </p>
<p>Using this technique means missing a lot of &quot;hidden gems&quot; tough. It also means, that you only find what you are activly looking for, or what you stumble upon by accident. Delicious on the other hand lets you find people who like the same things that you tought interesting - and then look at what they bookmarked. You get a link collection not of some dumb web-crawling spider-bot, but that of a true human beeing. Granted, quite a few or maybe many of her links will be of no interest for you, but if you found her by similar linked pages she is bound to have at least a tiny bit of common interest with you. And chances are good that there will be interesting pages at her delicious site as well.</p>
<p>I agreed with my friend fabian the other day that delicious of course is also a propaganda tool. By bookmarking something publicly, you implicitly say &quot;This is important&quot;. And your tags provide a (obvious or hidden) valuation. Inhowfar this might be abused remains to be seen - for the time beeing I don't think any del.icio.us-bombing is happening or would be very worthwhile.<br /> </p>
<p>Another point I find remarkable about delicious is the picture you get of a person of whom you know nothing but his chosen nickname and bookmarks (which in turn is an interesting subset of his interests). Try it with some random people!<br /> </p>
<p>There is a lot more to find out about delicious and the potential of social software in general - it remains to be seen if it turns out to be just another hype or something as essential to us in a few years as google is today. The benefit of using it is available now however - so start using it and tell me your nick!<br /> </p>
