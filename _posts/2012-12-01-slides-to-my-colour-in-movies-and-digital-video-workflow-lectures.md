	The (german only) slides to my two recent lectures at <a href="http://www.filmarche.de">filmArche Berlin</a> are online now. One online presentation about <a href="/presentations/farbe-im-film.html">Colour in Movies</a>, and two PDFs about <a href="/presentations/pdf/Codecs2012.pdf">Digital Video Workflow and Codecs</a> and <a href="/presentations/pdf/Workflow2012.pdf">Backups</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	On the topic of Backups I have written in the <a href="/node/121">two previous</a> <a href="/node/122">blog posts</a> that of course are a lot more accessible than just the slides.
