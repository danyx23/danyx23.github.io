<p>A few days ago my quest to study directing has finally come to an end as I have been accepted at <a title="Filmarche" href="http://www.filmarche.de">Filmarche</a>. This Film school is pretty special in that there are no dedicated Professors - instead the students organize their education themselfes, teaching each other and inviting people from the field for specific workshops/lectures. I think it sounds very promising and am pretty excited to see what it's like.</p><p>The website is currently still a bit of a temporary solution, I have to port everything over to the new version of the CMS I use and I'm still experimenting quite a bit. Once I'm done the whole navigation structure will hopefully make a lot more sense. So, please bear with it for the time beeing.<br /></p>
