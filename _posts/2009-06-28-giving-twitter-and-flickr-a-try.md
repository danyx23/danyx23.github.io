<p>I just started to give twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/danyx23">my twitter feed</a>) and flickr (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danyx23/">my photostream</a>) a try. Some of their networking tools are indeed nice.</p>
<p>Also, expect a report about my after effects frame rate conversion tests for the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos5dmarkii/">Canon 5D Mark&nbsp;II</a> here soon (30p -&gt; 25p).</p>
