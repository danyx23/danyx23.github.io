title: Fighting climate change effectively
---

In the last few months, climate change has been discussed with renewed vigor in the media and on social networks. More and more people realize that we have a problem but a lot of the current focus doesn’t seem to be directed at the pragmatic goal we should be aiming for:   mitigating climate change as far as possible.

To achieve this, the only thing that matters going forward is our global net total greenhouse gas emissions and this is what we have to effectively reduce (i.e. the absolute amount of CO2 or other greenhouse gases emitted minus whatever we manage to extract out of the atmosphere through additional trees or via technological means).

I wrote this post out of frustration with the current public discourse that doesn’t focus on achieving this goal effectively. I am not a climate scientist and thus this post can only collect a few high level ideas that I think are important but neglected. I tried to collect some numbers that provide a useful frame of reference, but of course they cannot be a complete picture. Take what I write with a healthy dose of scepticism - but I do hope that it will be valuable.

A lot of public discussion focuses on personal consumption lifestyle choices and moral arguments and I think that this is a harmful distraction. As Elizabeth Warren recently said in her poignant style:


    “This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about. ... They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers, when 70 percent of the pollution, of the carbon that we’re throwing into the air, comes from three industries”
    -- Elizabeth Warren

It seems to me that public attention is a very precious good and that one can think of this as a public attention budget that is quite limited. Concentrate too much on actions that have only very minor impact on absolute CO2 emissions and you risk saturating your audience without having much effect. Framing the problem as a moral question of personal consumption choices just does not have enough potential to reduce absolute emissions by a significant margin (more on that below). Arguments that are rooted in moral outrage often focus on demanding others to make individual sacrifices: become vegan; stop flying; give up your car. They focus much less on big items where substitution could be relatively painless like replacing coal with renewable energy for electricity generation. Additionally, moral arguments risks that people will give up some minor personal consumption but then feel they have contributed “enough” and not be willing to help introduce a meaningful carbon tax that would have the potential for a much bigger change.

Another problem of moral arguments is that they often lead to a rhetoric of catastrophe: tackling climate change is framed as a binary choice between dramatically changing everything - or dying. In this lies a real danger of evoking hopelessness: the whole world will not change dramatically all at once, so why bother doing anything at all, especially giving up things you personally enjoy?

We should instead aim for solutions that can bring down absolute greenhouse gas emissions effectively and focus minds on the areas that can really make a big difference. As I will outline below, I doubt that we will be able to still achieve a great or good outcome (staying below or 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees celsius global warming respectively). But if we can focus on areas where we can make big gains for relatively little cost then I think it is still very much possible to achieve a moderately bad outcome of somewhat above 2 degree celsius versus extremely negative outcomes for ecosystems and human livelihoods if we end up over 4 degree celsius.

If the reduction of absolute greenhouse gases is our goal, we should focus public discussion on the following three main areas:
a steadily increasing emission tax or carbon tax to align profit incentives with emission reductions
more research, development and bootstrapping of technologies to reduce emissions - especially in the neglected agricultural and steel/cement producing sectors as well as electricity storage
a creative diplomatic effort to create strong (trade) incentives for the big emerging economies to refrain from deploying coal for electricity production

The rest of this blog post will elaborate on this argument. To frame the discussion, I think it is useful to recall a few important numbers. The scientific opinion of the UN’s panel for climate research, the IPCC, is that we should try to constraint global temperature rise by 2100 to ideally 1.5 or at most 2 degree celsius versus pre-industrial average global temperature. The emissions our species has produced so far have locked in an increase of a bit more than 1 degree already, so we would end up with just somewhat below 1.5 degree even if we stopped any and all greenhouse gas emissions today.

A greenhouse gas emission budget can be calculated which expresses how many Gigatons of CO2 equivalent we can still put into the atmosphere to stay within a given temperature target. For 1.5 degrees, we have about 400 Gigatons left (estimates vary but they are in this ballpark). We currently emit around 45 Gigatons CO2 equivalent per year (around 35 Gigatons CO2 as well as Methane from agriculture that is equivalent to another roughly 10 Gigatons of CO2 in its effect). If you do the math, this means we can go on emitting at the current level for around 9 years and then have to go to 0 net emissions immediately; hardly a realistic scenario. Emissions can be offset if we find ways to remove additional CO2 from the atmosphere - e.g. by planting additional trees (that are not burnt later in their life) or by increasing plankton growth or via some other technical solutions (although  of such there are currently no large scale schemes on the horizon that would be economically viable). Whichever way you turn it, the 1.5 degree target looks pretty unrealistic at this point.
