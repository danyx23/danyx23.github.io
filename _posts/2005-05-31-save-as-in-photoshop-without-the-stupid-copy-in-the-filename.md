<p>Photoshop annoyed the heck out of me again today - every time you save an image as a filetype that does not support layers etc it adds &quot; copy&quot; at the end of the filename. Here is a script that saves the currently active document as a png at the same location where the psd file is stored. If you want to save as some other filetype you will have to change the script. Feel free to contact me if it you need help with it!</p><p>How to use:<br /> </p> <ol>   <li>Download and copy it into your Photoshop/Presets/Scripts/ directory</li>   <li>Restart Photoshop</li>   <li>Choose File-&gt;Scripts-&gt;SaveAsPNG</li> </ol> Developed &amp; tested on Windows XP, Photoshop CS2<br />
