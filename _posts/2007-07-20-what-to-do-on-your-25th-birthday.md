  Once a year, a certain, quite difficult question comes up: What to do on my birthday? Well, this time around&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;happened&nbsp;that&nbsp;I&nbsp;participated&nbsp;in&nbsp;a psychological experiment my friend Roman currently conducts.&nbsp;It&#39;s&nbsp;all&nbsp;about&nbsp;work&nbsp;overload&nbsp;and&nbsp;trying to teach computers to guess when a human reaches work overload from looking at thigs like EEG and EKG data. Pretty interesting stuff.

  Anyhow,&nbsp;the&nbsp;reason&nbsp;I&nbsp;devote&nbsp;a&nbsp;blog&nbsp;post&nbsp;to&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;because&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably&nbsp;the&nbsp;coolest&nbsp;photo&nbsp;ever of me at one of my birthdays. Enjoy :)
