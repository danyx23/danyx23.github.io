<p>A while ago I stumbled across a new programming language: <a title="Boo programming language" href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a>. It combines the nice syntax of the <a title="Python" href="http://www.python.org">python</a> programming language with the well designed <a title=".NET" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">.NET Framework class library / IL Language system</a>. This means it is not compatible with python software, but with every .NET component out there. It exists for <a title="MS .NET" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">MS .NET</a> and <a title="Mono" href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">MONO</a>, IDE Support is available through <a title="Sharpdevelop" href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/">#Develop</a> et al. . Among the best features: static typing (but with type inference, which spares you a lot of typing) &amp; duck typing, a lot of neat features from python and a few nice bits from ruby/perl (built in syntax for regex), compile time macros (think compile-time VS.NET code snippets) and lots more. I can't wait to use it in a real project! If you're into programming, definitly check it out!</p>
