Last week I shot my alpha project (the film you have to make after the first semester at the <a href="http://www.filmarche.de" target="_blank" title="Filmarche Filmschool">filmarche filmschool</a>), starring Anne von Keller and Cyrus Rahbar, DOP Inga Pfafferott, Producer Florinn Bareth, directed by yours truly. We went for both the dolly and the M2 35 mm Adapter, knowing that it was a bit of a gamble given our timeframe, but everything worked out nicely. We had a great team and I think the film will turn out to be beautiful. I know I sound like one of those lame hollywood making-ofs, but somehow I think everyone really put a lot of effort into this film and they deserve the praise :). Postproduction will take at least a month now and of course I will post more details as they emerge.
