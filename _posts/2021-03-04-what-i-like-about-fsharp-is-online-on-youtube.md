This Tuesday I gave a talk at the fantastic (currently zoom only) [Berlin Functional Programming Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Functional-Programming-Group) about F#. I gave a brief introduction to the language, then showed how to download and analyze some historic weather data and serve this up as a small SPA web app. Below you can play the recording - have a look and [let me know](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=DanyX23&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) if you have any feedback.
