title: Slides for my talk about Elm at Berlin.js
---
Last month I had the oppertunity to talk about [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) at the very friendly [Berlin.js](http://berlinjs.org) Javascript usergroup. If you don't know about elm, it's a pretty new, small language designed to create websites. The language is purely functional, nicely small, and modelled on Haskell and OCaml. Have a look at the slides if you are interested and follow the links on the third-to-last slide for more information! (If you use the arrow keys for navigating don't miss the slides that extend downwards - or just use the spacebar to see all).
