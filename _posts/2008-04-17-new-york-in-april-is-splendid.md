<p>I arrived in New York yesterday to visit my good friend Tom. Because of some stupid passport regulations Teresa couldn't come along and is getting another passport now - I really hope that she can come along on friday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I try to enjoy New York, which is pretty easy because the weather is magnificent. I'm pretty tired from walking around all day, but here are a few first photos from this beautiful city:</p> <p><img width="500" height="333" alt="" src="/files/u1/nycdb-7.jpg" /></p> <p><img width="500" height="333" alt="" src="/files/u1/nycdb-9.jpg" />&nbsp;</p> <p><img width="500" height="333" alt="" src="/files/u1/nycdb-8.jpg" />&nbsp;</p> <p><img width="500" height="333" alt="" src="/files/u1/nycdb-5.jpg" />&nbsp;</p> <p><img width="500" height="333" alt="" src="/files/u1/nycdb-2.jpg" />&nbsp;</p> <p><img width="333" height="500" alt="" src="/files/u1/nycdb-3.jpg" />&nbsp;</p> <p><img width="333" height="500" alt="" src="/files/u1/nycdb-4.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
