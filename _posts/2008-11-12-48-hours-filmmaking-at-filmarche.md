<p>I&nbsp;participated in the 48 hour film making session last weekend at my <a href="http://www.filmarche.de">filmschool</a>. I shot a 2 minute B-zombie homage with two classmates&nbsp;(Timo and Alexi) and a few folks who played the zombies. The film is online at vimeo, so I&nbsp;embedded it here in SD quality (but you can see it in HD directly on <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/2222358">vimeo</a>).</p> <p><object height="300" width="400"><param value="true" name="allowfullscreen" /><param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" /><param value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2222358&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" name="movie" /><embed height="300" width="400" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2222358&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1"></embed></object><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/2222358">Spur des Verderbens</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user926860">Daniel Bachler</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p> <p>As I&nbsp;wrote above, it is a short film that was entirely done in 48 hours (that includes coming up with the idea, writing/planning, shooting, editing, effects), so it is pretty short and has some rough edges, but I'm quite happy with the result.</p> <p>We shot the whole thing with my new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmclx3/">Panasonic Lumix LX-3</a> Photocamera in HD&nbsp;Movie mode. The LX 3 lacks some important controls (shutter time, full manual control in movie mode, no focusing and zooming while shooting) but it did a pretty decent job nonetheless. I was especially surprised by the quality of the sound (of course it is not nearly good enough for anything serious, but it is interesting how usable it still is). We shot everything with available light only, and the camera handled it rather well (the 2.0 max aperture at the wide end is a great thing - go Leica!). The sound you hear is all from the camera, except for the music and a few Foley sounds.</p> <p>The noise is pretty strong and we softened it a bit by processing the entire film in after effects with a slight glow (by adding a blurred version of the edit on top of the original and adding it with screen mode and about 40% transparency), but for render-time reasons we did not use any degraining solutions. If anyone is interested in the original material send me an <a href="http://www.danyx.com/contact">e-mail</a> and I&nbsp;will upload some of the original material to vimeo.</p> <p>The music we used is <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/de/album/830">Cellule</a> from the Band Silence who were kind enough to put their song on <a href="http://www.jamendo.com">Jamendo</a> under a very liberal license (Thanks for the nice song)</p> <p>We also used some sounds from <a href="http://www.freesound.org/">freesound.org</a> (see the credits for details)</p> <p>The film is released under a creative commons license:</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/" rel="license"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/de/88x31.png" style="border-width: 0pt;" alt="Creative Commons License" /></a></p>
