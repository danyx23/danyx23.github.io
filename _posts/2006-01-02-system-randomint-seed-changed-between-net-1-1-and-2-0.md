<p>Using the brilliant tool Reflector I found out that there is a breaking change in the constructor of System.Random between .NET Framework 1.1 and 2.0 - the random numbers generated by the same seed in both versions are different. Since this is not documented anywhere I thought I'd post it here. (Of course this is usually not a problem, but I relied on a certain sequence with a given seed for Unittesting).</p>
