<p>My latest movie,<a title="Emotionsbewilligung" href="/taxonomy_menu/2/2/20"> &quot;Emotionsbewilligung 23/517&quot;</a> is done. I will publish it at UTV next month and make it available in high quality via <a title="Bittorrent on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent">Bittorrent</a>. The movie is released under a <a title="The license under which the movie is released" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/de/">creative commons license</a>, so feel free to copy it and share it with your friends (or strangers) or show it in public as long as you conform to the license restrictions (basically: you may do nothing comercial with it, don't modify it and you have to mention my name as the author. Please note that you may only show/copy the entire movie, as I regard showing only part of it as an act of modification which is not allowed wihtout my written consent.)</p><p>I also assembled a DVD with all the movies I directed until now. Currently the only way to get is is by <a title="Contact me!" href="/contact">contacting me</a>, in due time I will release it via Bittorrent.</p><p>In other news I uploaded a new <a href="/photo">photo of myself</a>.&nbsp;</p>
