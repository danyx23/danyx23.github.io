<p>I'm doing a little lecture tomorrow at filmArche on colour grading and thought that I&nbsp;could share a few links on the topic here.</p>

<p>To give a feeling for the use of colour in movies, I&nbsp;really like the <a href="http://moviebarcode.tumblr.com/">moviebarcodes</a>. The artists who does them wants to stay anonymous, so I can only link to his tumbl site. The image below is that site where you can also order prints (I&nbsp;personally find them beautiful). Wired uk described the process of making these images very well as: [<em>the software the artist wrote takes</em>] every single frame of the film (and its constituent colours), stretches them vertically and lines them up in chronological order to create an image that gives a visual overview of how the film would look if you saw it all in one go.</p>

<p>Also very useful is <a href="http://prolost.com/">prolost</a>, the blog of Stu Maschwitz. He is a filmmaker with a vfx background and helped develop a number <a href="http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/magic-bullet-suite/">colour grading plugins</a> that can be used with several NLEs. Stu has a <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2010/8/10/colorista-ii-tutorials.html">collection of colour grading tutorials</a> for one of these plugins, Colorista II, on his site. I will show Magic Bullet Looks at my little lecture as it incorporates most of the important tools for a more complex grade and is compatible with NLEs but also usable as a standalone tool to grade stills.</p>

<p>Grading stills in preproduction and finding reference stills from movies or other sources is a very important preproduction step in my opinion. I really like <a href="http://screenshotworld.blogspot.com/">screenshotworld</a> for browsing stills from a number of different movies.</p>

<p>As you may know, digital colour grading is a rather recent practice that took off only in the early 2000s with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/">O&nbsp;Brother Where Are Though</a> being credited as the first feature film to be fully digitally graded. Digital colour grading offered a whole array of more sophisticated and more targeted manipulation of colour, which is sometimes used to a very positive effect. However, as this blog post on the <a href="http://theabyssgazes.blogspot.com/2010/03/teal-and-orange-hollywood-please-stop.html">Teal and Orange plague</a> nicely illustrates, it has also led to an overuse of this very powerful colour contrast.</p>

<p>Human colour perception is very sophisticated (although some animals have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp#Eyes">even weirder colour perception</a>)&nbsp;and colour grading therefore a very important and complicated subject. I'll write more on it some time soon, but for now I&nbsp;hope the links here are a nice read.</p>
