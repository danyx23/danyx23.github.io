<p>I just made my sister very happy by recovering lost photos from her last holliday that were still on a flash card but unreadable. If you ever need a tool like this the best one for this job in my experience is <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec</a>. It doesn't have a great user interface, but it works very well and is available on a number of plattforms. If you don't know exactly what option to choose when it asks you something, just pick the default&nbsp;(just be sure to select the right drive to recover from and a folder on your hd to save the recovered images to).</p>
