<p>I uploaded a bunch of <a href="/gallery2/" target="_self" title="View my photos">photos</a>, namely of Lajas wedding, the round the world trip last year with teresa, and teresas birthday brunch in february.</p><p> The workflow is pretty annoying, the more I do this the more I see what is wrong in todays photo editing/publishing workflows. I'm gonna write about this in more detail sometime soon, but just to mention some things i deem pretty essential to the sanity of computer users as data quantities keep rising:</p> <ul>   <li>Metadata that is stored in a generic way (not exif here, xmp there, iptc somewhere else and ipv3 in yet another place)</li>   <li>Metadata that is stored independant of the data (there is a reason this is called <em>meta</em>data, you know)</li>   <li>Metadata that is indexed centrally by the filesystem</li>   <li>Support for walking down whichever transformation road you want (IPTC&lt;-&gt;EXIF&lt;-&gt;XMP&lt;-&gt;something usefull)</li>   <li>OS independant libraries to read/process this, with high-level wrappers for a broad range of scripting languages</li> </ul> <p>and so on, but these are the essentials that I see atm. Feel free to comment on this, or suggest possible solutions.</p>
