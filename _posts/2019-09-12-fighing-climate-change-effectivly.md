title: Fighting climate change effectively
---

In the last few months, climate change has been discussed with renewed vigor in the media and on social networks. More and more people realize that we have a problem but a lot of the current focus doesn’t seem to be directed at the pragmatic goal we should be aiming for:   mitigating climate change as far as possible.

We can’t change the emissions of the past that have led to a rise in temperatures of a little more than one degree celsius already. The only thing we can influence and therefore the only metric that really matters, are our global net total greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the absolute amount of CO2 or other greenhouse gases emitted minus whatever we manage to extract out of the atmosphere through additional trees or via technological means). This is what we have to effectively reduce .

I wrote this post out of frustration with the current public discourse that doesn’t focus on achieving this goal effectively. I am not a climate scientist and thus this post can only collect a few high level ideas. Getting emissions to a much lower level than today will be a huge task and here I just pick a few areas that I think are neglected and could be major contributors. I tried to collect some numbers that provide a useful frame of reference, but of course they cannot be a complete picture. Take what I write with a healthy dose of scepticism - but I do hope that it will be valuable.

A lot of the current public discussion focuses on personal consumption lifestyle choices and moral arguments and I think that this is a harmful distraction. As Elizabeth Warren recently said in her poignant style:

>> "This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about. ... They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers, when 70 percent of the pollution, of the carbon that we’re throwing into the air, comes from three industries [...] construction, electricity generation and the oil industry" -- Elizabeth Warren

I see three main problems with the personal consumption and lifestyle choices arguments. First, it seems to me that public attention is a very precious good and that one can think of this as a public attention budget that is quite limited. Concentrate too much on actions that have only very minor impact on absolute CO2 emissions and you risk saturating your audience without having much effect. It is therefore important that public attention is focus on getting the big political solutions in place and not waste time debating whether or not eating beef is morally justifiable.

Second, framing the problem as a moral question of personal consumption choices just does not have enough potential to reduce absolute emissions by a significant margin. Aviation for example accounts for 2% of global emissions. A voluntary consumption cut by rich consumers will not change nearly enough and we have to instead focus on aligning the entire global economy to emit less.


Third, the current rhetoric of moral arguments often invokes images of catastrophe. Tackling climate change is framed as a binary choice between dramatically changing everything - or extinction. In this lies a real danger of evoking hopelessness: the whole world will not change dramatically all at once, so why bother doing anything at all, especially giving up things you personally enjoy? If the situation is hopeless, shouldn’t we just enjoy it while it lasts?


Instead we should aim for solutions that can bring down absolute greenhouse gas emissions effectively and focus minds on the areas that can really make a big difference. As I will outline below, I doubt that we will be able to still achieve a great or good outcome (staying below or 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees celsius global warming respectively). But if we can focus on areas where we can make big gains for moderate cost then I think it is still very much possible to achieve a moderately bad outcome of somewhat above 2 degree celsius versus extremely negative outcomes for ecosystems and human livelihoods if we end up over 4 degree celsius.

If the reduction of absolute greenhouse gases is our goal, we should focus public discussion on the following three main areas:
* {% newthought 'a steadily increasing emission tax' %}  or carbon tax to align profit incentives with emission reductions
* {% newthought 'more research, development and bootstrapping of technologies' %} to reduce emissions - especially in the neglected agricultural and steel/cement producing sectors as well as electricity storage
* {% newthought 'a creative diplomatic effort' %} to create strong (trade) incentives for the big emerging economies to refrain from deploying coal for electricity production

The rest of this blog post will elaborate on this argument. To frame the discussion, I think it is useful to recall a few important numbers. The scientific opinion of the UN’s panel for climate research, the IPCC, is that we should try to constraint global temperature rise by 2100 to ideally 1.5 or at most 2 degree celsius versus pre-industrial average global temperature. The emissions our species has produced so far have locked in an increase of a bit more than 1 degree already, so we would end up with just somewhat below 1.5 degree even if we stopped any and all greenhouse gas emissions today.

A greenhouse gas emission budget can be calculated which expresses how many Gigatons of CO2 equivalent we can still put into the atmosphere to stay within a given temperature target. For 1.5 degrees, we have about 400 Gigatons left {% sidenote 'sn-remaining-budget-1-5' 'Estimates for the budget to stay below a certain temperature target vary quite a bit but most are in this ballpark; this one is from the [German MCC institute](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html); Wikipedia has a [good overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_budget) of other estimates'%}. We currently emit around 45 Gigatons CO2 equivalent per year (around 35 Gigatons CO2 as well as Methane from agriculture that is equivalent to another roughly 10 Gigatons of CO2 in its effect). {% marginfigure 'mf-emission-paths' 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Emission_paths_for_reaching_the_Paris_Agreement.jpg/800px-Emission_paths_for_reaching_the_Paris_Agreement.jpg' 'Trajectories for attemting to stay within a 600Gigaton CO2 budget - [figure by Stefan Rahmstorf via Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emission_paths_for_reaching_the_Paris_Agreement.jpg)' %} If you do the math, this means we can go on emitting at the current level for around 9 years and then have to go to 0 net emissions immediately; hardly a realistic scenario. Emissions can be offset if we find ways to remove additional CO2 from the atmosphere - e.g. by planting additional trees (that are not burnt later in their life) or by increasing plankton growth or via some other technical solutions (although  of such there are currently no large scale schemes on the horizon that would be economically viable). Whichever way you turn it, the 1.5 degree target looks pretty unrealistic at this point.

To stay within 2 degrees warming, we have about another 800 Gigatons left. This gives us another 18 years or so at current emission rates after which we have to suddenly switch to 0 emissions, or, preferably of course, a somewhat smoother curve to reduce our global emissions as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the trend curve of emissions goes the other way.

It is worth noting that the higher the temperature increase will end up being, the worse the repercussions for our ecosystems and our habitable areas and global living standards will be. Thus, even if we slightly miss the 2 degree target, this would be a much better outcome than the ~3.5-4 degree increase we are currently on a trajectory towards. {% sidenote 'sn-glen-peters' '[This article by Glen Peters](https://www.cicero.oslo.no/no/posts/klima/stylised-pathways-to-well-below-2c), a climate scientist at the Cicero institute for climate research in Oslo is a sobering look at the feasibility of staying below 2 degrees' %}

If we look at emissions by region we see that absolute emissions have started to slowly decline in the last few years in both Europe and the US, although at a very slow pace. At the same time, the emissions of especially China rose very quickly as it becomes wealthier and has big construction and energy needs. Climate diplomacy should therefore be an important part of the solution, but let's first look at the things that rich countries (such as Germany, where I live) can do by themselves.

Capitalism is an amazing tool if its negative sides can be contained (though containment is of course a constant political struggle). A carbon tax in the rich countries would be a great start to aligning the normal market incentives of increasing profits with the goal of reducing greenhouse gases. It would mean that areas where switching to clean sources of energy are cheapest would do so first, out of pure monetary considerations.

For such a tax we could either aim for a simpler carbon tax that would apply to fossil fuels and other forms of energy based on their CO2 contributions, and would be paid for by consumers when the fuel is bought. Alternatively we could be more ambitious and try to introduce an emission tax that covers not only fossil fuels directly but also the energy expended when producing products; so for example beef would be taxed since cows contribute to greenhouse gas emissions by burping methane and thus make meat alternatives more competitive; industrial products would get a similar additional price pressure, so investing in low carbon steel would become something economically desirable for companies since low carbon steel products would be taxed less. The details of such a more wide ranging tax would be tricky to get right since they would have to cover imports of goods and there remain some tough questions (e.g. you would have to try and assess how energy intensive imported goods are and it would probably be a challenge to make this WTO trade rule compliant; how would you avoid creating a gigantic bureaucracy to measure and verify emissions?; can you price the destruction of forests into the goods that were produced on the cleared land? ...).

An emissions trading scheme if designed well could also work instead of a carbon tax; here, a fixed number of certificates for emissions is generated by the state and these are then traded in a market where polluters have to buy certificates for their emissions. The end result of both strategies when designed well is similar, just the way of getting there is different. In a trading scheme the emissions are fixed and the price is cleared by the market; when using a carbon tax, the price for emissions is set and the emissions fall accordingly. I prefer a carbon tax because the stable and increasing price is transparent and can be used for long term planning. The price for petrol for the normal consumer would carry the same price as that paid for industry that burns coal for steel production per unit of CO2 emissions. I also fear that it is easier to obfuscate emission cheating in a trading scheme or for political favours to get out of hand as they did with the European Carbon Trading Scheme.

Even an imperfect tax would already be a good step. It should probably start at a level comparable to petrol taxes (and replacing those) and then subsequently increase year by year to increase the incentives to avoid or replace emissions (3% annual increase in real terms seems to be an often cited number {% sidenote 'sn-vox-overview' 'Estimates for the social cost of a ton of CO2 vary substantially. Vox has a good overview of [carbon tax proposals](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/7/20/17584376/carbon-tax-congress-republicans-cost-economy) that talks about this cost as well' %}). For a few years now many international oil companies have used an internal carbon price since they anticipate something like this coming and need to decide on big fossil fuel extraction investments with a lifetime of several decades. The price they use is usually around 45 EUR/ton of CO2 and this is also what is used as a medium estimate for the social cost of CO2 emissions {% sidenote 'sn-vox-overview' 'Estimates for the social cost of a ton of CO2 vary substantially. Vox has a good overview of [carbon tax proposals](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/7/20/17584376/carbon-tax-congress-republicans-cost-economy) that talks about this cost as well' %}. An annual 3% increase of the tax rate would mean that the tax would double roughly every 25 years.

Modern cars emit a ton of CO2 for roughly every 8.000 kilometers they drive {% sidenote 'sn-co2-per-km' 'The EU mandates that new cars can only emit a certain amount of CO2 per driven kilometer. It targets fleet wide averages, the current of 130g CO2 / km is from 2015, for 2021 a [lowering to 95 g CO2 / km is planned](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/cars_en) '%} , so an initial level of taxation at current petrol prices would be roughly 45 €/ton in many European countries already. Coincidentally, the amount of CO2 emitted when travelling by airplane in modern passengers airplanes at close to capacity is roughly similar for the distance travelled - traveling 1000 km via plane produces roughly the same emissions as travelling the same distance alone in a car {% sidenote 'sn-flight-emissions' '[Carbonindependent](https://www.carbonindependent.org/22.html) has an overview that shows how this comparison is calculated. Raw CO2 Emissions are actually lower per passenger kilometer at around 90g CO2/km but emitting them at high altitude is probably significantly worse for the climate and so the number that is used is 180g CO2/km, somewhat higher than that of cars. It shows how crazy inefficient our cars are with their heavy weight and poor energy efficiency. '%}. In this Setup, a plane ticket for a return flight of a distance of 1000 km would incur additional initial taxes of 10 Euros.

In Europe the ideal would be to switch to a simple carbon tax that is levied on all fossil fuel use in all sectors of the economy without exception and that subsumes existing taxes on petrol, electricity etc. If that is politically too difficult then a second best option would be to keep the current solutions (petrol and other energy taxes and the  European Carbon Trading Scheme), but ensure that they are harmonized as far as possible to penalize CO2 emission equally and to get rid of any subsidies and existing tax rebates for fossil fuels.

In the US to the best of my knowledge the current level of taxation is far too low (and there are even tax breaks for certain forms of fossil fuels). In the US as well as in other rich countries where a carbon tax doesn’t exist yet on a reasonable enough level, introducing a carbon tax should be a main political goal.

To make such a tax politically viable and avoid broad opposition, the windfall from such a tax should be directly sent to citizens as quarterly or yearly flat per capita cash payments (as opposed to lowering income taxes or similar which would be less visible and would benefit richer people more). This way companies and individuals could each try to lower their particular fossil fuel consumption to pay less tax and the proceeds would be distributed equally, thus being very regressive in effect since a few hundred euro a year are a much bigger benefit for a poor family than for a rich one.

If a carbon tax would be levied at 45 € / ton, the tax income for a country like the US given its current emissions would be around 240 billion €, so every resident would be paid around 750 € per year. Inequality is a big concern when it comes to energy taxes since often rural populations are both poorer and have higher energy consumption needs per capita. However, since the tax would be collected from industry as well as individuals but the proceeds be paid out to individuals only, the immediate additional expenses from fuel and heating should be offset by the payouts for most people, including poorer rural families (indirectly the costs for energy intensive products would rise by the additional taxes incurred in their production but I think that such effects would not be as visible to consumers and consumed more by higher income segments)

There are many details to discuss, but I think something along the lines described above would create a moderate but wide-reaching incentive for companies and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint, simply out of economic interest. As such, they should be a short term political goal within rich countries. Vested interests in energy intensive export industry will rally against this on the grounds that it will disadvantage them versus their international competitors. Here I would argue that this is not a strong enough reason against such a tax given the overall benefits. Additionally, by pioneering low carbon technologies they will be in a much better position internationally in the medium term when other countries follow suit.


The second area I think we should focus on is investment in research and development of climate change mitigation technology. Rich countries should lead the way here and heavily invest in such research and share the proceeds generously with poorer countries. For research and development

Research and development should focus more on sectors with big emissions that have been neglected so far, like agriculture and construction. To get an idea of the magnitudes, consider that if we could half the emissions of producing concrete we would do much more for the planet than if we got rid of all air traffic(aviation accounts for roughly 2% of global emissions, concrete use for 8% {% sidenote 'sn-cement' 'Chatham house is a good resource on [lowering cement emissions](https://reader.chathamhouse.org/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete#). Gatesnotes has a great broader overview of [ideas around construction that incorporates plastic and steel](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/A-question-to-ask-about-every-climate-plan)'%})). Among the promising research ideas for agriculture there is for example the idea that adding a little bit of certain algae to the feed of cattle drastically reduces their Methane emissions {% sidenote 'sn-algae' 'MIT Technology review has a [good article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612452/how-seaweed-could-shrink-livestocks-global-carbon-hoofprint/) about this'%}.

Electricity production is responsible for a large part CO2 emissions because a lot of it is produced by burning coal, oil or gas. Luckily with photovoltaics and wind power we already have cost competitive alternatives, but the big missing part is electricity storage on a grid scale. Chemical batteries are expensive, toxic and have limited livetimes. The main tool we have to shift electricity production in time is water pump storage, where excess electricity is used to pump water up into the dams of hydro power stations and then released again when demand is high. Innovations will be desperately needed in this area and should be a big focus of research {% sidenote 'sn-ccs' 'To tackle emissions from fossil fuels that are hard to replace otherwise, carbon capture and storage will be necessary.[Ycombinator has a great overview of some approaches in this space](http://carbon.ycombinator.com/)' %}. One interesting approach for electricity storage is the idea of stacking concrete blocks on top of each other to use them similar to pump storage, like Energy Vault is planning to do.

We should also try to be clever in how we push technologies that are getting to the cusp of viability by designing competitions with big prizes for commercialization (Similar to what the US military arm DARPA did in the early 2010s for self driving vehicles). We should also subsidize carbon mitigating technologies that are not competitive yet. Germany half-knowingly did something like this in the 2000s with their subsidy for solar power - it created a solar industry (first in Germany, then in China) which led to the rapid tumbling of prices of production. Because of this we now have solar energy that is so cheap that in many places it is cheaper than coal for new power plants. (But at the same time we of course have German consumers fed up with high prices that make it hard to get off the dirty lignite coal - getting the balance right in theses things is hard).


But neither a wide use of carbon taxes in rich countries nor strong research programs will make much of a difference if we do not also focus on another crucial element: climate diplomacy. Today, China emits more greenhouse gases than the US and Europe combined. Both India and China are rapidly building coal power plants. As their wealth and living standards improve, many not-yet rich countries will need energy and construction on a large scale (yes, some of the emissions attributed to China are for products that are exported to rich countries but this is only about ~13% of China's total emissions {% sidenote 'sn-china-export' '[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-embedded-in-trade) has more information on this topic'%}). In absolute terms, coming up with good solutions to reduce these emissions is of paramount importance.

Here I think we should get creative with trade deal incentives and similar offerings. If the EU could strike an attractive deal with China that would hinge on the condition of replacing (or refraining from building) coal power with clean alternatives, then this might be a tremendously effective way of reducing emissions. Additionally, such a deal could provide a blueprint for other countries as well - the greener you build your electricity grid etc, the more we open our markets for you. An example of this could be that "low emission beef" could be exempt from import duties.

A historic blueprint we could use as inspiration is the Marshall plan. Europe, the US and Japan should think about ways of using direct investment and similar tools on a large scale to create clean energy in emerging economies. Another area that is worth thinking about is how to reward countries with forests for not destroying those in favor of short term profits. The challenge will be to create good incentive structures and modes of governance; it must not become a form of eco-colonialism. If we get this right, it could have a huge return investment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.


In this post I focused on net absolute CO2 emissions but very often you hear different arguments that are based on per-capita emissions or historic total emissions. They can be a backdrop for political solutions but in the end the only thing that matters going forward are absolute emissions. Indeed, rich nations got rich by consuming vast amounts of carbon based energy and still consume more fossil fuels per capita. But high historic emissions in the rich world can't translate into emerging economies now using similar amounts of fossil fuels. The moral dimension of the argument should translate into a strong research effort and sharing the results freely, thus helping other countries walk a better path towards prosperity while still becoming rich. Add to this that most of the "low-hanging fruit" regarding CO2 emissions will be found in the world's coal power stations that are active now or currently under construction, many of which in the emerging economies. We all have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but we shouldn’t let per capita arguments get in the way of efficient solutions.


This problem of tackling climate change is very hard - our governance structures and decision horizons are ill aligned with the scale and duration of the problem of climate change. The situation is bad, but we have the power to drastically lessen a potentially terrible outcome for the wider ecosystems, ourselves in the future and for future generations.

So what are we to do as individuals? I think the primary focus should be to push politics and public discourse to concentrate on effective means to reduce total global emissions via any means that work. In the rich countries we should make sure to do our own part and not look hypocrite (looking at you, German lignite plants) - but the best leverage for the overall picture will be to unleash the power of technology and market incentives while making sure that they help the currently growing countries the most.

If you are a politician (or know one), try shifting the position of your party towards effective means of greenhouse gas emission reduction. If you are a journalist (or know one), I think it would be great to use the limited airtime the topic of global warming has to focus minds on the big payoffs, not on small individual contributions. If you are neither, think about where you can influence public discourse in other ways - attending demonstrations, writing about it, or making the case face to face. In all of these efforts, the focus should be efficient reduction of absolute global CO2 emissions and aiming for big wins in all areas where they are possible and to demonstrate that as voters we want a carbon tax and similar measures to be enacted.

If you are in science or technology, consider switching to research or engineering related to global warming, especially in currently under-appreciated areas. So far the only time I would say international coordination in favour of climate policy worked well was around banning CFCs to stop the destruction of the Ozone layer (which also had a huge mitigating effect and avoided even faster global warming). Political action was only viable because technological alternatives were available (and affordable). In many areas today I think we are still missing economically viable alternatives to current greenhouse gas emitting technology. Bret Victor’s essay ["What can a technologist do about climate change?"](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) is an excellent resource on framing the climate change problem and thinking about technological solutions.

If you are in diplomacy or a think tank, consider switching to a role where you can come up with creative ideas for climate diplomacy. This is a space that I think is currently woefully neglected to a point where even the European Green parties don’t seem to give it much thought. We need to push this idea into the political mainstream.

Finally, I think it's important that global warming becomes a major point in making voting decisions - basically a party without a clear agenda to effectively reduce greenhouse gases should stop being a viable option for as many people as possible. It is my hope that this will play out more and more at least in Europe and create competition on this topic between parties. Where currently the various green parties are often seen as the only ones even aiming to do anything in this space there is a big underexplored political space for liberal or center-conservative parties to try to put forward more pragmatic and economically attractive alternatives to the often very ideological party programs of the greens. I would love to see conservative parties giving greens a hard time on global warming topics for mainstream voters - however unrealistic this may seem at the moment.

Working against climate change will be a major challenge for all of us for the rest of our lives. There will be many setbacks and counter trends. But this makes it all the more important to try to target efforts at big absolute reductions that are supported by a large public and not get lost in inconsequential arguments about things that don’t have much potential for bringing absolute emissions down. Let's try to do start doing the right thing - and keep working on it.
