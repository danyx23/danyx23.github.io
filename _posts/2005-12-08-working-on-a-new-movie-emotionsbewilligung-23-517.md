<p>I am currently working on my first movie since moving to Berlin - it's a short for the admission to the <a href="http://www.dffb.de/" title="DFFB">DFFB</a> film academy here in Berlin. The movie tells the story of Paul, a young man who has filed an application for an &quot;allowance of emotions&quot; about 7 months ago, but he still hasn't received it. Upon inquiring, he is told that the allowance was denied - to learn the reason why, he has to file a protest. Whether this is a good idea remains to be seen...</p><p>Shooting has been completed last week, I am currently busy cutting the film. It will probably be finished by mid-december, and will go online at <a href="http://www.utv.at" title="UTV">UTV</a> early next year. Stay tuned for more info! <br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
