<p>By now I think almost every internet user knows <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia portal">wikipedia</a>, quite possibly the most useful website there is. I have recently started to look into how I can contribute to this amazing collection of human knowledge, and I was surprised about how difficult this is - there are simply so many articles that are better already than I could ever hope to make them. However, it seems that photographs are still much needed in certain areas, and this is where I started contributing today. My first contribution to wikipedia: (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Geisha-kyoto-2004-11-21.jpg" target="_blank" title="A photo of two geisha I contributed.">photo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha" target="_blank" title="The article it appears in">article it appears in</a>). </p><p>Consider contributing to wikipedia, it feels really good! &nbsp;</p>
