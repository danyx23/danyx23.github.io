<p>Life is good again! My eye infection is gone and my new, shine, sexy <a title="X41" href="http://www-131.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=4611686018425155293&amp;storeId=10000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=4611686018425021052&amp;dualCurrId=1000073&amp;catalogId=-840">IBM/Lenovo X41</a> arrived - a convertible laptop (both laptop and tablet pc). I can work outside, use it as a notebook (as in, a bunch of paper sheets one draws and writes on) and use a whole bunch of <a title="powertoys for tablet pc" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/tabletpc.mspx">new, weird applications</a>. Among other uses its great to use it for drawing (I will never draw on paper again - how can anyone work without layers?). If you are considering buying a laptop in the near future, definitily try this sweety.</p><p>I also started redesigning this website a little, especially in regard to the structure of the site. I hope to put it online within the next two months.&nbsp;</p><p>A new script is also in the works. The working title is &quot;Die Gl&uuml;cksmaschine&quot; (the happiness machine). The story is about an old man suffering from parkinson who gets an operation that works a little too well - it makes him manic. The film is about the consequences this has on his relationship as well as the dilemma his doctors are faced with - should they get rid of the sideeffects, even if the patient likes them?</p>
