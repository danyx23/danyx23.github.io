<p>Together with DoP Jan-Paul Gauly and editor Marius Wawer I have worked on the concept for a post apocalyptic action short film for quite some time now. Over time the story and setting became better and better, but our day jobs kept us all very busy this summer so we never got to actually shoot anything.</p>

<p>We now found a couple of days next week when all of us will have time to shoot a trailer for our film. If all goes well this will help us sell the idea and acquire some funding for a short or maybe even feature length film.</p>

<p>The film is set in the near future, 12 years after a big catastrophe led to the radioactive contamination of most of Europe. The few survivors live a bleak live, poisoned by radioactivity and threatened by wild animals and other survivors in the constant fight for food and shelter. Our two heroes, KATJA and her brother UWE, roam the lands, searching for a hospital that is said to be functional. On the way they are joined by MINCHI, a woman who claims to know the way. They fight off gangs and try to survive the contamination, but the longer they go on the more their personal conflicts escalate...</p>

<p>We created a (German) folder, have a <a href=")/files/920 Milligray - Kurzfilm Projektmappe.pdf">look at it</a>.</p>
