<p>Why is it that you always find out about these things <em>after</em> you spent an hour writing a script to work around it? Use the adobe filebrowser in Photoshop - it looks a bit strange if you are used to Windows, but it remembers the last file format, doesn't add &quot; copy&quot; to filenames and it allows drag-n-drop favorites. Neat.</p>
