			<td>Backdoor is a short film that is arguably closer in spirit to a comic (or a graphic novel as they like to call themselves nowadays) than to a movie. The visual space of the canvas becomes a meta-camera, a constructed eye that moves over a seemingly infinite chain of pictures arranged on a virtual comic page. As this eye passes the panels, a very short sequence of the movie is played, like a handshake or a mouth speaking half a sentence. Yet all the pictures, as in a comic, fit togehter to tell a story, in the case of Backdoor the story of a small group of hackers in the near future, who, by accident, discover a way to manipulate <em>Delphi</em>, the e-voting system that enables a true direct democracy. As if the question on how to deal with the increadible power wasn&#39;t enough, a shady character appears and tries to convince them to install an aristocracy. 

			<p>

			The movie then deals with the tensions that arise within the group and the outside events that bring the movie to a dramatic end.
