title: My talk about Elm at GOTO Berlin 2017 is online!
---

Last Autumn I gave a talk at the [GOTO Berlin](https://gotober.com/) conference on the [programming language Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). I tried to convey why I think it is a very useful tool for web development, how it can live up to it's promise of "Zero Runtime Errors" and what it feels like to develop production apps with it. Have a look and let me know your feedback in the comments or [on twitter](http://twitter.com/danyx23)!
