I recently had the idea to use my blog to write down recipes that I come up with. I love cooking, and sometimes I make up nice dishes that I think could be worth sharing. And, as I also love films, I thought it was only natural to name all my recipes after great films or directors. So, here goes my first one: &quot;Duck a la Antonioni&quot;. 
</p>

<br />
Michelangelo Antonioni was an Italian director whose films were often very precisely composed and had a simple elegance. This recipe hopes to capture some of the same spirit (I recommend &quot;La Notte&quot; to go with it): <br />

<blockquote>
	Ingredients for 2 persons: approx 400g Duck filet with skin, 1/2 Fennel, 3 Carrots, Potatoes, Parsley.<br />
	<br />
	Heat up a pan (use no fat as the duck has plenty of its own) and fry the duck filet. Cut the fennel to small pieces and fry it in some olive oil until it starts to caramelise, then add the cut carrots and just before everything is done salt &amp; freshly ground pepper. Cook the Potatoes in water, then fry them in a little butter and add the parsley. Voil&agrave;!<br />
	<br />
	(A little note: usually I use onions with all vegetables, but for this dish I think it&#39;s a good idea to put some faith in the fennel and carrots and let them stand by themselves)
