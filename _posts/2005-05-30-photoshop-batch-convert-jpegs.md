<p>I wondered for ages how to convert a folder full of photoshop files to jpegs. Maybe it was obvious to everyone else in the world, but just in case anybody else is lost on this as well, I found two methods today. Method 1:<br /> </p> <ol>   <li>Open a picture in PS <br />   </li>   <li>Create a new action in the actions window in PS (it should switch into record mode)<br />   </li>   <li>Click File-&gt;&quot;Save as&quot;. Change the directory to whatever you want. Change the filetype to jpeg. Do NOT change the filename (even if it includes the stupid &quot;copy&quot;). Press ok.</li>   <li>Close the file, say &quot;Don't save any changes.&quot;</li>   <li>Stop the recording of the action. It should look like this now: <div class="image">   <a href="/node/20"><img width="395" height="175" border="0" alt="Screenshot convert to jpeg" src="/files/images/Screenshot-convert-jpeg.png" /></a>   <div class="caption">&nbsp;</div> </div><br />   </li>   <li>Choose File-&gt;Automate-&gt;Batch and select the new action, for Source choose the folder you want to convert, hit ok and watch photoshop do it's job.</li> </ol> <p>Method 2:</p> <ol>   <li>Choose Scripts -&gt; Image Processor</li>   <li>Adjust settings</li>   <li>Go</li> </ol> &nbsp;
