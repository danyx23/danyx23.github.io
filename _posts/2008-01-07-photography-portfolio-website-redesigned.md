Teresa and I finally finished redesigning our photography portfolio website <a href="http://www.iconoclash.org" title="Iconoclash">iconoclash.org</a>. Iconoclash.org is our commercial portfolio, so we went for a rather slick look and the selection doesn&#39;t include any of our more experimental photos. I built the main menu in flash, the galleries were created in Adobe Lightroom with the help of the great <a href="http://www.lightroomgalleries.com/index.php" title="Lightroom Galleries">LRG Gallery</a> templates and the text pages (contact and info links) were implemented with the content management system <a href="http://drupal.org" title="Drupal">drupal</a> that also runs this website here.

With this done I can now finally finish my short film <a href="/Coriolis">Coriolis</a> and take up editing <a href="/Go" title="Go">Go</a> again, the short film Teresa and I shot last summer.&nbsp;
