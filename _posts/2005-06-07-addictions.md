I always kinda considered myself to be fairly resistant against addictions, but the anime series <em><a title="Hikaru no Go on senseis wiki" target="_self" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no go</a> </em>has really caught me on the wrong foot. I watched 50 episodes (with 20 minutes an episode) in just a bit more than 3 days - yes, in a way it is reasearch for <a title="About Go" target="_self" href="/taxonomy_menu/2/2/18">my new go film</a>, but this became a little extreme.<br />
