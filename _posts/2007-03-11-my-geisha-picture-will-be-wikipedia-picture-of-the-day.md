About half a year ago I uploaded a photo of two geisha to wikipedia and on March 15th it will be featured picture of the day at the english version of wikipedia! I'm really proud and will go through my other photos to see if there is some more stuff that I could contribute. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:POTD/2007-03-15" target="_blank" title="Picture of the day">Take a look</a>.<br /><br />
