<p>The page is starting to look the way I want it to. Over the weekend I switched to the phptemplate engine of drupal and adapted the manji theme. I am still annoyed over the incompabilities between Adobes new XMP Standard and most exif processing tools out there - basically if you manipulate a photo in photoshop and safe it the camera exif data like when it was shot etc. gets converted into a different format that almost no tool can process.</p><p>Well, the big chunk of work thats left on this page is the movies. I am still thinking about which container format and codec to use, and whether to embedd the movies in the webpage or start them in a standalone player.</p><p>I'm also thinking a lot about workflows lately and the handling/usability of filesystems. I will probably write something about it soon on this page.&nbsp;</p>
