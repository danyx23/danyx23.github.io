<p>I started writing a series of blog post with the title &quot;<a href="http://blog.iconoclash-photography.com/taxonomy/term/12">Artefacts of Light</a>&quot; at the <a href="http://blog.iconoclash-photography.com">Iconoclash Photography blog</a>. The series will cover different phenomena in photography and the first post is about Bokeh (the rendering of out of focus light sources, as seen above). Future posts will cover things like Film Grain, Back Light and Empty Space. I always appreciate feedback, so let me know what you think about it - thanks!</p>
