<p>I currently do some compositing work for the short film <a href="http://www.bordercrossing-der-film.de/">Bordercrossing</a>. I took over from another compositor who did a couple of shots that the director and editor now want me to make some changes to. Some of those shots are very long compositions and I was asked to make changes to only some fragments of them and render those out. Since I found myself repeatedly creating new compositions that contained the big master comp as it's only layer but only the working area time fragment of it, I&nbsp;decided to write a small script to do this. You can find it attached or on <a href="http://aenhancers.com">aenhancers.com</a></p>
