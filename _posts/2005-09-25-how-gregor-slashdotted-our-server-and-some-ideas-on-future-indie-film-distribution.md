<p>For those of you who don't know the term &quot;slashdotted&quot; - slashdot.org is a geek site that has an amazing amount of visitors where links to interesting websites are posted. This often has the effect of &quot;killing&quot; a webpage that gets a link from slashdot, because all of a sudden several thousand users want to access it. Well, I haven't yet had the honor to be linked at slashdot, but Gregors e-mail about the <a href="/node/47" target="_self" title="Gregors and Zsolnas wedding photos">wedding pictures</a> we put online on this site had a similar effect to our poor server. See the statistics <a title="Traffic statistics for september" target="_blank" href="https://www.utv.at/webalizer/danyx/usage_200509.html">here</a>.</p><p>In other news, I'm back in Berlin and attended a <a title="Berliner Filmgruppentreffen" target="_self" href="http://treffen.berliner-filmgruppen.de/">coming-together </a>of a bunch of short filmers from germany, most of them from Berlin (Kudos to <a title="Marc Ludwigs homepage" target="_self" href="http://www.film-produktionsleitung.de/">Marc</a> for organizing this great event!). Even though I couldn't be there all the time, I'm glad I could participate in the inspiring talks.</p><p>One of the topics that I was particularly interested in was the distribution of short films via the internet. <a title="Berndt" target="_self" href="http://www.jungefilmszene.de">Berndt</a> from the Bundesverband Jugend und Film is currently trying to organize a national (for now) database for young no/low budget directors to inform themselfes about and, at a later point in time, submit their films online to several german and international film festivals. Interesting stuff! We talked about the problem of getting as many films online as possible - like <a title="UTV - Independent web television vienna" target="_self" href="http://www.utv.at">UTV</a> does in Vienna. Since every movie that gets submitted to such a system has to be screened (to secure the system against politically or otherwise unacceptable or illegal material), a system such as this one would benefit enormously from the screening systems already in place at many festivals around the country.</p><p>This of course means a preselection that is biased. One idea I presented that has been growing in my head for a few weeks now is to use <a title="Peer to peer software at wikipedia" target="_self" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer to peer</a> software such as <a title="Bittorrent at wikipedia" target="_self" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent">BitTorrent</a> to distribute shorts without a need for huge servers with limitless capacity and bandwidth. A network of blogs and newsletters could direct attention to some outstanding work from a bottom-up perspective. Since this is a complicated matter, I will write a special blog entry about how I envision such a system in the next couple of days. Stay tuned!&nbsp;</p>
