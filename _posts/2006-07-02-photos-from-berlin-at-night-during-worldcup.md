People are getting pretty crazy about soccer here in Berlin. There are almost no bars left that do not have a TV set standing around. Even if Germany doesn't play there are crowds of people in those places watching the games. Tonight I strolled around the area where I live and took some photos (<a href="/gallery2/v/Other/berlinwm/" title="Photos from Berlin at night during world cup">view them here</a>). What makes this&nbsp;all even stranger is the sudden explosion of german flags - something unseen until a few weeks ago, but by now every second car and every third flat displays one. Pretty weird. I thought Germany&nbsp;had&nbsp;gotten&nbsp;over&nbsp;this&nbsp;patriotism&nbsp;thing... <br /><br />In totally different news, I'm making good progress on updateing the structure/navigation of this site, a new version will be online soon.<br /><br />And, last but not least, a film-tip: In the last few days I watched a lot of woody allen movies&nbsp;- If you haven't seen it yet, definitly watch &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot;, im my humble opinion his best movie to date, absolutely hillarious.<br />
