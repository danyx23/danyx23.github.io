<p>Long time no update, so here are some news:</p><p>I have started to use the <a title="TRAC issue tracking tool" target="_self" href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">TRAC</a> wiki/issue-tracking tool/subversion-webfrontend. It's really decent and I recommend it to anyone who develops nontrivial software with subversion (in a team). </p><p>My good friend <a title="Blog of nikolaus perneczky" target="_self" href="http://kinolaus.lefant.net">Nikolaus Perneczky</a> has a new blog that you still don't find with google, so I link him here :). He writes some interesting movie reviews (in german), so take a look.</p><p>My good friend <a title="Fabians homepage" target="_self" href="http://www.lefant.net">Fabian</a> visited me and Nikolaus a week ago. Photos will be online soon.<br /> </p><p>We visited Hendrik in Hamburg, again, photos will be online soon.</p><p>I'm currently trying to slowly start something like UTV (web-television plus equipment/knowledge pool in Vienna) here in Berlin. Stay tuned for more...</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
