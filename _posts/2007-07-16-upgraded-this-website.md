I finally finished moving this website to my new server and I used this opportunity to polish this website a little. Some links might have been broken but should work again soon.

My last movie, Coriolis (it will have its own page here soon) is about to get finished. <a href="http://www.jfprins.com/" title="Jeanfrancois Prins">Jeanfran&ccedil;ois Prins</a>, an amazing jazz musician and incredibly friendly person is busy composing the music and I try to polish the visual end of the film. If all goes well we will be able to start sending it to festivals around the end of August.

The shooting of my next film, Go, is approaching frighteningly fast (shooting is scheduled for mid-August at the moment). This film too will soon get it&#39;s own page on this site.<br />

I will write more regularly now that the website has finally moved. Check back soon!
