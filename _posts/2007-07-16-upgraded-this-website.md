I finally finished moving this website to my new server and I used this opportunity to polish this website a little. Some links might have been broken but should work again soon. 

</p>

<p>

My last movie, Coriolis (it will have its own page here soon) is about to get finished. <a href="http://www.jfprins.com/" title="Jeanfrancois Prins">Jeanfran&ccedil;ois Prins</a>, an amazing jazz musician and incredibly friendly person is busy composing the music and I try to polish the visual end of the film. If all goes well we will be able to start sending it to festivals around the end of August.

</p>

The shooting of my next film, Go, is approaching frighteningly fast (shooting is scheduled for mid-August at the moment). This film too will soon get it&#39;s own page on this site.<br />

<br />

I will write more regularly now that the website has finally moved. Check back soon!
