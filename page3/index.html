        <p>Last Autumn I gave a talk at the <a href="https://gotober.com/">GOTO Berlin</a> conference on the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">programming language Elm</a>. I tried to convey why I think it is a very useful tool for web development, how it can live up to it’s promise of “Zero Runtime Errors” and what it feels like to develop production apps with it. Have a look and let me know your feedback in the comments or <a href="http://twitter.com/danyx23">on twitter</a>!</p>

        <p><em>Note: This post was written in 2016. Since then, the introduction of the <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE stack</a> has significantly improved the sitation in F#, but the basic ideas of this blog post are still valid - they are just a lot nicer now :)</em></p>

<p>When the call for the <a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/tag/fsadvent/">F# Advent Calendar</a> came up I thought that this would be a great opportunity to finally check out a technology stack that intrigued me for quite a while now: Using F# on the backend (which by now works well on linux/osx as well as windows) and also on the frontend, via <a href="http://fable.io/">Fable</a>, the F# to Javascript compiler backend. I have played a bit with F# in the past but I wanted to see how well this particular combination works in practice.</p>

<p>This is the third post in a series of posts about <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. In my <a href="/2016/02/12/signals-in-elm.html">first post about Signals in Elm</a> I briefly mentioned ports. Since they are the only way to communicate with “native” Javascript, they certainly warrant a closer look. If you haven’t checked out the last post in this series on <a href="/2016/02/19/tasks-and-effects-in-elm.html">tasks and effects</a> I suggest you do that now as this post will build on these concepts.</p>

<p>This is the second post in a series on some of the concepts in <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> that might be a bit puzzling when you start out with Elm. In the <a href="/2016/02/12/signals-in-elm.html">last post about Signals in Elm</a> I wrote about Signals and how they are behind the scenes of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StartApp.Simple</code>. In this post I get into long running operations like XHRs (aka AJAX). There are two closely related types that are involved in this, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tasks</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Effects</code>, and the exact differences between can be confusing in the beginning. So let’s dive right in:</p>

<p>I have rewritten a webapp from React/Redux to <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> over the last few weeks and am really enjoying the language so far. Elm is a compile to Javascript, purely functional language that was built specifically to create web UIs with it. It is inspired by several functional programming languages, especially Haskell and OCaml. I have participated in the Elm google group quite a bit lately and I noticed that even though the Elm docs are really good, there are some concepts that are a bit hard to understand and to differentiate from each other. I am therefore starting a mini-series of posts about different concepts in Elm. This first one is about Signals - and why you don’t see them much in many smaller Elm programs even though they are always there.</p>
