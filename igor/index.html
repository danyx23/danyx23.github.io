    <h1>Igor calendar bot</h1>

    <p>Igor calendar bot is a google calendar CLI application. It let's you fetch your google calendar entries so that you can quickly see events from your personal google calendar in the terminal.</p>

    <p>The application is very basic so far. For now let's you do two things: list your calendars</p>

    <img src="/img/igor-calendar-list.png" alt="Igor calendar list view" style="width: 55%;">

    <p>and see upcoming events for the next 5 days:</p>

    <img src="/img/igor-calendar-upcoming.png" alt="Igor calendar upcoming view" style="width: 55%;">

    <p>In the future, the app will get new functionality to let you work with your calendar data in <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">nushell</a>.</p>

    <p>When you run it the first time, you need to give consent to access your google calendar data. Your data will only be accessed by the cli that you run on your computer and not be shared with anyone else or used for anything.</p>
