          <p>By now I think almost every internet user knows <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia portal">wikipedia</a>, quite possibly the most useful website there is. I have recently started to look into how I can contribute to this amazing collection of human knowledge, and I was surprised about how difficult this is - there are simply so many articles that are better already than I could ever hope to make them. However, it seems that photographs are still much needed in certain areas, and this is where I started contributing today. My first contribution to wikipedia: (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Geisha-kyoto-2004-11-21.jpg" target="_blank" title="A photo of two geisha I contributed.">photo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha" target="_blank" title="The article it appears in">article it appears in</a>). </p>
<p>Consider contributing to wikipedia, it feels really good! &nbsp;</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>A while ago I stumbled across a new programming language: <a title="Boo programming language" href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a>. It combines the nice syntax of the <a title="Python" href="http://www.python.org">python</a> programming language with the well designed <a title=".NET" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">.NET Framework class library / IL Language system</a>. This means it is not compatible with python software, but with every .NET component out there. It exists for <a title="MS .NET" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">MS .NET</a> and <a title="Mono" href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">MONO</a>, IDE Support is available through <a title="Sharpdevelop" href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/">#Develop</a> et al. . Among the best features: static typing (but with type inference, which spares you a lot of typing) &amp; duck typing, a lot of neat features from python and a few nice bits from ruby/perl (built in syntax for regex), compile time macros (think compile-time VS.NET code snippets) and lots more. I can't wait to use it in a real project! If you're into programming, definitly check it out!</p>

        <h1><a href="/coding/2006/01/27/script-to-automate-drupal-mulitisite-instance-setup.html">Script to automate drupal mulitisite instance setup</a></h1>
        <p class="author">
          <span class="date">27 January 2006</span>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I just finished a first version of a script to automate the somewhat tedious task of setting up a drupal instance. The script is work in progress so please be carefull. I am not very used to the python scripting language, so there may be some things that are awkward at least. Neither do I know about the internals of drupal, so it is quite likely that some of the things I do in this script are not optimal or maybe even dangerous from a security point of view. If you encounter errors or have suggestions on what to improve, please tell me so (either by adding a comment to this post or by <a href="/contact" title="Contact info">writing me directly</a>). The script is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" title="GPL">GPL V2 or later</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the description of the script as printed when called without arguments:<br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Usage: muybridge_install_drupal /path/to/webdir domain<br />This script will setup a shared drupal instance into<br />a directory of your choice. This directory should be one<br />that you just created, and contain nothing important.<br />The script will create a database, a database user and&nbsp; <br />the necessary files.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />WARNING: This script is work in progress. You may shoot yourself in the<br />foot with it. Please only use it when you understand what it does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />When an error occurs at some stage, changes made until that point are NOT reverted.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you use the script, check the settings section in it and adapt it to your needs. The script has to be run as a user that has write access to the directory you want to install the shared instance into, as well as the sites dir of the shared drupal directory and /etc/cron.hourly/ . You will be asked for the mysql root password so that a new database and user can be created (adapting this to use another mysql user who has sufficient privileges would be trivial tough). Ok, I hope I remembered everything important - more info will be added to this post when found.<br /></p>

          <p>A comment on an article at <a title="slashdot" href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> on a new <em>trauma pill </em>seems to be promising stuff for a movie script. Maybe I'll write something around this theme. <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/01/18/0629251">The article at slashdot.</a> From the comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, rape victims will be made victims twice because they will not be able to both use this pill to prevent the psychological damage and be considered a reliable witness. Defense Lawyers will say, just as you have assumed, that her memories were changed and there's no way she could identify her attacker reliably. And gullible people on the jury will go for it. &quot;We can give you this pill that will help you be whole, but you'll have to give up on having a solid prosecution against your attacker.&quot; What a choice. Ironically, I would imagine that by reducing the tramatic effect of the attack, the victims memories might actually be more reliable.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
