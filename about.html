                Hi! I’m Daniel.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m a software engineer and a photographer. I have used a wide variety of programming languages and am currently most interested in functional programming, especiall Elm, Haskell and F#. At the moment, I am working on a Slideshow editor in the browser using Elm and a serverless backend running on AWS Lambda.
