          <p>I will shoot some more tests with the 5D tomorrow with DoP Philip Leutert and post more results soon. (Update:&nbsp;blog posting about these tests is <a href="http://www.danyx.com/retiming-with-twixtor-results">here</a>)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, here is a little trick on how to find optimum settings for time warp in After Effects:&nbsp;use brainstorm. It shows you 8 new variations of the selected effect settings, which is ideal to quickly find those settings that remove obvious artifacts. Select the parameters &quot;Vector Detail&quot;, &quot;Global Smoothness&quot;, &quot;Local Smoothness&quot;, &quot;Smoothing iterations&quot;, &quot;Error Threshold&quot; and &quot;Block Size&quot;, then press the Brainstorm button (at the top of the timeline):</p>

<p>A few fellow students sent me some comments and links which I&nbsp;want to repost here:</p>

    <li>Discussion about<a href="http://cinema5d.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=594&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a"> retiming in After Effects on 5DCamera forums</a>:</li>

    <li>Some people think that <a href="http://www.apple.com/shake/">Shake</a> has the best optical flow retiming, others seem to think <a href="http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/pkg_plugins.aspx?ui=B9D69803-AA9A-4772-B784-38A280234576">Kronos</a> (from the Foundry)&nbsp;is best&nbsp;(which is odd because this is what After Effects uses in the time warp effect and that one seemed to have some pretty obvious problems with our test footage) some say Twixtor is best. I'd love to see a comparision of Shake and Twixtor, does anybody know one?</li>

        <p class="author">
          <span class="date">04 July 2009</span>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Two weeks ago, a few friends from <a href="http://www.filmarche.de">my film school</a> took the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos5dmarkii/">Canon 5D Mark II</a> to the Ostsee coast to test whether it would be suitable for the short film they want to shoot in August. They gave me the material they shot so I&nbsp;could try various retiming methods to see if it was possible to get a decent looking 25p copy of the material. (Update:&nbsp;I&nbsp;have since shot some more tests, read about them <a href="http://www.danyx.com/retiming-with-twixtor-results">here</a>. Update Nr 2:&nbsp;I&nbsp;have written two extensive blog posts on how retiming works and how to do it in After Effects. Find them <a href="/retiming-methods-shootout">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Most technically minded filmmakers will be aware of why the 5D is such a hot topic right now, but for those who aren't, here is a short summary:&nbsp;The 5D is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dslr">DSLR Camera</a> that can record video in 1080 30p (HDTV). Why does this matter?</p>

<!--break-->

<ul>

    <li>The <a href="http://prolost.com/blog/2008/8/20/sensor-size-cheat-sheet-update.html">full frame sensor </a>means very, very little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field">Depth of Field </a>especially compared to all current video cameras that cost below 20K Euros. It means getting a lot of what we associate with film look without stupid workarounds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-of-field_adapter">35mm adaters</a></li>

    <li>It needs very little light. AFAIK it can shoot with significantly less light than the <a href="http://www.red.com/cameras/">RED ONE</a>.</li>

    <li>We can use very good photographic prime lenses that are a lot cheaper than cine lenses.</li>

    <li>More reasons <a href="http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Lantern_Firmware_Wiki">are here</a></li>

</ul>

<p>It was inevitable that the worlds of the great DSLR&nbsp;cameras with big sensors and of video cameras with their optimized ergonimics for long shoots would at some point converge, and we are currently seeing some of the first cameras that bridge the (increasingly artificial) gap. Because cameras like the 5D are the first cameras that try to do both, there are many shortcomings. How serious these are for your project is something that only you yourself can decide by testing it, but here is a list with the downsides I&nbsp;regard as being the most serious:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Frame rate fixed to 30p (this is a problem if you want to screen it in Europe on DVD/TV - Pal is 25p - or in cinemas - film is 24 fps)</li>

    <li>Fancy compression (mpeg 4) that can have some weird artefacts</li>

    <li>Nearest Neighbor or similar scaling algorithm - this leads to very bad moir&eacute; when filming subjects with a lot of fine detail</li>

    <li>Crushed blacks /&nbsp;no raw - it makes the images look great right off the camera, but you are very limited in what you can do in your colour correction</li>

    <li><a href="http://dvxuser.com/jason/CMOS-CCD/">Rolling shutter </a>- skewed vertical lines or weird wobbly movement in horizontal motion</li>

    <li>Handling optimized for still photography</li>

    <li>Video recording time limited to about 12 minutes</li>

</ul>

<p>Of these problems, the frame rate thing is the most serious for no budget filmmakers in Europe. If it is impossible to create a PAL Screener DVD, there isn't a lot you are going to be able to do with your film. Also, if you get lucky and your film gets a cinema distribution, you will need a 24 fps version. So, unless Canon ships a firmware update that lets us shoot in 24/25p, the question is:&nbsp;is there anything we can do to create this great camera to shoot shorts and be able to watch them afterwards (in 25p/24p?)</p>

<p>The answer is maybe - there are 4 possible ways to convert video from 30p to 25p that I&nbsp;am aware of:</p>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Play it slower</strong>. Perfect image quality because every frame is played as it was recorded. Everything will get a slight slow motion effect. Unusable for anything containing dialogue. Might be interesting for action /&nbsp;commercials.</li>

    <li><strong>Throw away frames</strong>. Creates very jerky video, IIMHO unusable for anything.</li>

    <li><strong>Retime it using frame blending</strong>. For every output picture, two pictures are blended together (kind of like a double exposure). This works well for scenes with little movement and it produces very predictable results. Gets very noticeable with quick movements or pans.</li>

    <li><strong>Retime it using optical flow analysis</strong> (also called Pixel Motion and similar). Complex algorithms try to analyze where groups of pixels are moving and calculate intermediary frames. Creates cleaner results than frame blending in many cases, but can horribly fail if it gets confused.</li>

</ul>

<p>Most modern NLEs can use the first 3 or all of the above methods. Since I like to use After Effects for things like this because it always puts image quality first and speed second, this is what I&nbsp;tried.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&nbsp;tried all of the above methods with two shots that I&nbsp;got from my friends. So far, the tests were not very conclusive because only very few scenes were shot with a 180 degree shutter (most used much shorter exposure times because they didn't pack enough ND). We will shoot some more tests next week and I will post those results with some example videos, but here are my findings so far (all tests were done in After Effects at full resolution and screened on a full hd lcd screen):</p>

<ul>

    <li>Frame blending is too noticeable when there is significant subject movement. Camera movement seems to be less noticeable.</li>

    <li>After effects' optical flow analysis can easily get confused (at least with the default settings). Below is a still frame where the Sun just came out behind one the actors and the entire picture was shredded.<img height="283" width="500" alt="" src="/files/vlcsnap-1567684.jpg" /></li>

</ul>

<ul>

    <li>The <a href="http://www.revisionfx.com/products/twixtor/">Twixtor Pro 4.5 Plugin</a> for After Effects seems to produce results that are noticeably more stable. In the two rather difficult tests I&nbsp;rendered there were no visible problems. Also, Twixtor is able to render artificial motion blur with very little additional render time, which should make the output smoother.</li>

</ul>

<p>BTW, when you want to try your own tests, try to figure out what the program will be doing and if it actually makes sense. One possible path that a program might take would be to assume that the material was converted from 24p film to 60i via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine">2:3 pulldown</a> and you simply want to reverse this process. DON'T do this, it would badly mess up your video!</p>

<p>As I&nbsp;wrote above, my tests were inconclusive thus far. Twixtor looks promising, but it's hard to judge if the resulting material looks correct or if something feels weird. The 5D is a very interesting camera and I&nbsp;would have good use for it's photographic capabilities as well and already own a nice selection of canon lenses. But to know if it will be useful to create a short film suitable for the cinema screens at film festivals I&nbsp;will have to do some more testing (next time I&nbsp;will also upload some example videos, I&nbsp;promise).&nbsp;Of course, if Canon would release a firmware update for 25p I&nbsp;would be in the store the next minute (Canon?&nbsp;Are you listening?!)</p>

          <p>I currently do some compositing work for the short film <a href="http://www.bordercrossing-der-film.de/">Bordercrossing</a>. I took over from another compositor who did a couple of shots that the director and editor now want me to make some changes to. Some of those shots are very long compositions and I was asked to make changes to only some fragments of them and render those out. Since I found myself repeatedly creating new compositions that contained the big master comp as it's only layer but only the working area time fragment of it, I&nbsp;decided to write a small script to do this.

If you like to browse through photos, do take a look!<br /><br />There are still some sections missing, but the portrait portfolio as well as the wedding portfolio and 3 more individual samples are already online. There is also some information on how we work and before and after samples of the digital development and retouching we do.<br /><br />The rest of this post is about technical details about the page, so read on if you are interested in this kind of thing, everybody else will probably be terribly bored by all this :).<br /><br />The page is currently flash 9+ only. This will probably enrage a few people as flash is a proprietary plugin that has a very poor security record, but it is sadly still the only thing that allows rich, cross-browser/platform consistent content authoring and that has a reasonably big install base.<br /><br />Rich content authoring is often used as a euphemism for things that no one ever needed but that some web designer thought would be cool. What I care about in a portfolio website is not the ability to use video, but precise control over the typography, the ability to animate images and as little problems as possible in the process. Sadly, html still provides none of the above.<br /><br />The only other contestant btw would have been <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverlight">Microsofts Silverlight</a>. While it seems very promising (especially the programming model, which in version 2 is a pretty complete version of the .NET environment plus an XML based markup language for the design of the gui elements) the install base is too small at the moment. <br /><br />The site itself is one main flash file that I did in Flash with quite a bit of Actionscript 3 for the fade effects and navigation logic, and a modified version of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/autoviewer/pro/">Autoviewer Pro</a> for the gallery. <br /><br />Flash has come a long way since it’s early days, and while there are still a lot of things that are pretty silly and smell of bad compromise, all in all it has become a pretty decent tool. Things like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/">SWFAddress</a>, a small flash component and java script, make it possible to have deep links in one flash file, which means the URL in the address bar changes when you click around inside the flash object and enables the browser back button to work like it would with conventional HTML pages. This last thing is something that I always found to be very important, as using the back button to navigate is such an important concept in the web. Oh, and SWFAddress also allows you to use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> to see which pages our visitors actually look at, which is important information to make future versions of our website better to navigate.<br /><br />When we thought we were done with our site, we posted it to <a target="_blank" href="http://photo.net/">photo.net</a> and asked for feedback. One of the things we learned from this was that some people were too impatient to wait for the fade effects to complete, so we implemented the quick navigation feature on the top right side. <br /><br />Creating and especially fine tuning the website so that everything looks pretty and works like expected was a lot of work, but I think that it was worth it. Hopefully we will still like it in a year and can concentrate more on making photos now :)<br /></p>
